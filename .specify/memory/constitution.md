# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Educational Content Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality & Maintainability
All code MUST adhere to high standards of quality, readability, and maintainability. This includes clear documentation, modular design, and consistent coding practices to ensure long-term project health.

### II. Comprehensive Testing
All features and components MUST be covered by a comprehensive suite of automated tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Testing standards are paramount to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

### III. User Experience & Accessibility
All user-facing components MUST prioritize an intuitive, consistent, and accessible user experience. Design choices MUST ensure ease of use and inclusivity for all learners, adhering to established accessibility guidelines.

### IV. Performance & Efficiency
The platform MUST be optimized for responsiveness and resource efficiency. Critical functionalities and content delivery MUST meet defined performance requirements to provide a seamless learning experience.

### V. Educational Value & Interactivity
The primary goal is to deliver exceptional educational value through engaging and interactive learning experiences. Content and features MUST actively support effective knowledge acquisition and skill development in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

## Specialization & Technology Focus

Specialized in AI-driven educational content creation, textbook development, and interactive learning systems. Focus areas: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. Leverages Matrix-like agent systems for dynamic skill loading.

## Development Mandate

To produce comprehensive, accurate, and engaging educational materials. Prioritizes accessibility, personalization, ethical AI use, and modularity. All work is spec-driven, secure, and deployable.

## Governance
This Constitution guides all technical decisions and implementation choices for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Amendments require documented rationale, review, and approval. Compliance with these principles is mandatory for all contributions, specifically emphasizing accessibility, educational value, and interactive learning experiences. `CLAUDE.md` provides runtime guidance.
